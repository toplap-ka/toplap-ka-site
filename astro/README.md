# what is this

it's a little [astro](https://astro.build/) project to build the code collection.

usage:

```sh
npm i # only needed once
npm run build
```

this will build the code collection into /code-collection.

This also means that you shouldn't do any changes in /code-collection directly, as it will be wiped on build.
